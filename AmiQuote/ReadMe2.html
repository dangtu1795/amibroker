<ul>
  <li>added &quot;Max days&quot; edit to control maximum intraday backfill length. Specifying
    lower than maximum allowed days results in faster download and less data
    to transfer. <strong>Google
    Intraday</strong> supports <strong>1..15</strong> max days for 1-minute bars
    and <strong>1..60</strong> max
    days for 5-minute bars. <strong>Yahoo Intraday</strong> supports only <strong>1-day
    of 1-minute bars</strong>    and only <strong>1 and 5 days of 5-minute</strong> bars.
    Specifying other combinations (such as 2, 3 or 4 max days for 5-minute bars)
    for Yahoo results in retrieving

  <li>Implemented fix for inconsistent  Yahoo  date
    format change (some Yahoo Historical servers changed the date from DD-MMM-YY
    to YYYY-MM-DD,
    but
    some
    others do
    not, so
    downloads from Yahoo use two different formats. AmiQuote now detects new
    format YYYY-MM-DD and converts to old format on-the-fly)</li>
  <li>Added an option to send cookies (to enable this, check Tools-&gt;Settings, &quot;Allow

<ul>
  <li>  Calls to AmiBroker automation objects now use late

    (like LPT, PRN, etc...) <br>

  <li><font size="3">more Yahoo historical servers
        to select from (from B..L) in Tools-&gt;Settings</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">automatic server rotation mode
        (registered version only) that switches servers B to L on round-robin
        manner allowing to download in several threads with lowered risk of your
        IP being blocked by Yahoo.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.68?</b></font></p>
<ul>
<li>updated default Yahoo Historical URL to ichart.yahoo.com</li>
<li>added ability to select particular Yahoo Historical server in Tools-&gt;Settings:<strong>  Yahoo Historical Server<br>
  </strong>Yahoo uses server load-balancing so data are delivered by many servers
  &quot;appearing&quot; under one URL. Problem is that some servers from timem to time
  are not updated (offer only old data) while others are up-to-date. This new
  setting allows to handle such cases by selecting the server that is up-to-date.
  Default setting is &quot;ichart.yahoo.com&quot; which works in usual load-balancing scheme
  (switched servers). But you can also select Server B, C, D, and E. As of today
  (June 8th) servers B and D offer up-to-date data, while server C and E offer
  old data (only upto 4th and 3rd of June respectively). This may however change
  at any time. Please note that selection of Servers C, D and E is available
  only in registered version of AmiQuote.</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.67?</b></font></p>

        date is earlier than last date of quote available in AmiBroker then earlier
        date is used.</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.66?</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>better detection if AmiBroker is or is not running<br>
  </li>
  <li>eSigCentral option removed<br>
  </li>
  <li>added new free FOREX
    data source providing EOD and Intraday forex quotes.<br>
    <br>
    FOREX data source works ONLY with the following symbols:<br>
    EURCHF,EURGBP,EURJPY,EURUSD,GBPUSD,USDCHF,USDJPY<br>
    Attempt to download any other symbol with &quot;Forex&quot; data source will
  result in error message.<br>
  Intraday downloads are available only in registered version of AmiQuote<br>
  </li>
  <li> last
    update date for each ticker individually is retrieved only if database has
    less than 50 symbols. Otherwise the update date of the first ticker is taken
    for all.This speeds up ticker list retrieval in large databases.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.65?</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>new &quot;All sessions (quote.com)&quot; check box added. Turning this on causes
      that 24-hours trading is included in downloaded quotes (important for futures
      like ES04M). When this switch is off only regular trading hours are included
      in downloaded quotes.</p>

  <li>AmiQuote warns about &quot;eSigCentral&quot; being unavailable</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.64?</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>when doing &quot;auto-update AmiBroker database&quot; AmiQuote does NOT switch back
      to Yahoo Historical, hence allows you to set any source and still use Tools-&gt;Auto-update
      in AmiBroker.</p>

  <li>after downloading you can double click the item in the list to open downloaded
    file in the Notepad. This works also in case of errors in downloaded file</li>
  <li>cookies set by Internet Explorer are not sent to Yahoo server </li>

    and 1000 ms between requests</li>
  <li>new command line switches accepted:<br>
    /download   - triggers automatic download on start<br>
    /close - causes automatic close of AmiQuote after download<br>
    <br>
    Example command line:<br>
    <br>
    Quote.exe C:\mylist.tls /download /close<br>
    <br>
    - this will open ticker list from C:\mylst.tls, run automatid download (and
    import if &quot;automatic import&quot; box is selected) and close AmiQuote after download/import
    is finished<br>
  </li>
  <li>(on user request) maximum number of simultaneous downloads from Quote.com
    increased to 4</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.60?</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li>new experimental source: Integratir. US stocks only. Free. EOD quotes.
    (note this source is rather slow and may be removed)</li>
  <li>$NAME directive added to the downloaded file ensures that ticker is not
    renamed even if AmiQuote needs to rename file for symbols using Quote.com's
    convention
    that

  <li>minimum connection timeout increased to 10 seconds and minimum download
    timeout increased to 20 seconds</li>

    quote faster</li>
  <li>prepared for new GetTickers method in AmiBroker 4.51.0 that allows to get
    last update date on per-symbol basis leading to better work in &quot;auto-update&quot;
    mode. Also new AmiBroker 4.51.0 will skip composites so they are not added
    to download list.</li>
  <li>maximum number of simultaneous downloads from Quote.com decreased to 2
    (bigger number cause troubles with quote.com anyway)</li>

  <li>added initial delay between requests (delay that is added before attempt 
    to download each new symbol data) to the Settings page. It is defined in milliseconds 
    (1/1000 part of the second). It should help the owners of very fast connections 
    to slow down AmiQuote and avoid problems with Yahoo rejecting too frequent 
    requests.</li>

  <li>Added symbol translation table ( Tools-&gt;Symbol Translation Table menu 
    ) that allows to get symbols from alternative source without need to rename 
    tickers in AmiBroker. It can be used for example to update Yahoo database 
    from MSN. If you define ^DJI, $INDU pair AmiQuote will issue request for $INDU 
    to MSN server when the ticker list contains ^DJI (Yahoo-style symbol). A sample 
    translation is included (msn.translations file - loaded automatically at startup).</li>
  <li>Added some checks for Quote.com mode so it displays correct error message 
    if &quot;feature available to subscribers&quot; is received from Quote.com 
    server</li>
  <li>Added check for operating system reserved names like PRN.AX - they are renamed 
    to PR_.AX to allow storing such file in windows (should I say MSDOS) operating

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>INSTALLATION</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>If you have installed AmiBroker already, no special installation of AmiQuote 
    is required. Just unzip AmiQuote package to a separate directory (the default 
    is &quot;C:\Program Files\AmiBroker\AmiQuote&quot;). If you haven't installed 
    AmiBroker yet it is recommended to do so, because AmiQuote uses MFC libraries 
    (version 6.0) that are supplied with AmiBroker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>QUICK START</b></font></p>
<p><i><u>Note: this procedure works only if you have AmiBroker installed:</u></i></p>
<ol>
  <li>Launch AmiBroker and AmiQuote</li>
  <li>Choose <b>Tools-&gt;Auto-update AmiBroker database</b> (or corresponding 
    toolbar button) </li>
</ol>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>HOW IT WORKS</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>AmiQuote loads (or retrieves from AmiBroker) a ticker list file (.TLS) which 
    is simple ASCII file with ticker symbols, then parses it and downloads data 
    from either Yahoo Finance or Quote.com servers. Then, when you start the download 
    process, it requests the data from Yahoo and stores downloaded data in the 
    separate .AQD (daily) or .AQH (historical) or .AQI (intraday bar) files for 
    each ticker. After download, if AmiBroker is running, AmiQuote will import 
    the quotes into AmiBroker automaticaly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>USAGE</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Below you will find some tips on using AmiQuote 1.2 with and without AmiBroker. 
    More detailed instructions will be provided with the upcoming AmiBroker 3.65.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Using AmiQuote in stand-alone mode</i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Although AmiQuote is provided as a companion program to AmiBroker it is however 
    possible to use it without AmiBroker. Here is a simple procedure of downloading 
    quotes using stand-alone AmiQuote:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Launch AmiQuote</li>
    <li>Open supplied example file DJIA.TLS in the directory DJIA<br>
      This will load example ticker list (components of Dow Jones Industrial Average) 
    </li>
    <li>Choose between downloading current or historical or intraday interval 
      bar quotes (intraday interval bars are available only for US exchanges)</li>
    <li>Click on green arrow toolbar button (Start download)<br>
      now for a couple of minutes you can watch the download operation progress 
    </li>
    <li>When all downloads are complete you can close the program and find appropriate 
      .AQD (daily quotes) or .AQH (historical) or .AQI (intraday) files stored 
      in the directory where TLS file is located. </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Using AmiQuote with AmiBroker</i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Automatic update</b></font></p>
  <p>The easiest method to work with AmiQuote and AmiBroker is to use the procedure 
    given in <b>Quick Start</b> section of this document. Just run AmiBroker and 
    AmiQuote and choose <b>Tools-&gt;Auto-update AmiBroker database</b>. This 
    method updates historical quotes from the last date present in AmiBroker upto 
    today. When performing automatic update, AmiQuote performs internally 4 steps 
    a) retrieves the ticker list from AmiBroker (all stocks loaded currently in 
    AmiBroker);<br>
    b) gets the last quotation date available in AmiBroker;<br>
    c) performs historical download from last date upto today;<br>
    d) instructs AmiBroker to import downloaded files.</p>
  <p>AmiQuote now supports over 50 international exchanges in &quot;historical&quot; 
    and &quot;daily&quot; modes.</p>
  <p>Note that AmiQuote currently supports a new command line parameter: <b>/autoupdate</b>. 
    This option forces AmiQuote to perform automatic update procedure without 
    user intervention. <br>
    You may setup you custom tools menu in AmiBroker to call AmiQuote with this 
    argument:</p>
  <p><code>C:\Program Files\AmiBroker\AmiQuote\Quote.EXE /autoupdate </code></p>
  <p>If you do so, you will be able to update your database with a single click.</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Manual operation</b></font></p>
  <p>Automatic mode is nice but there are cases when you have to perform some 
    tasks manually. There is a good old document describing that mode of operation 
    at: <a href="http://www.amibroker.com/docs/ab304.html" target="_blank">http://www.amibroker.com/docs/ab304.html</a> 
    . Everything written in this document remains valid with one exception - now 
    importing to AmiBroker are performed automatically if you have <b>Automatic 
    import</b> checkbox marked.</p>
  <p>There are also several cases when you prefer to do things manualy, then please 
    don't forget about some useful tools available at your fingertips:</p>
  <p><b>File-&gt;Open, File-&gt;Save, File-&gt;Save As </b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>These functions enable you to load and save your edited ticker lists for 
      future repeated use.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Edit-&gt;Add tickers</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>This function allows you to add the tickers to the list. Just type space 
      separated tickers into the field that will show up when you choose this 
      function.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Edit-&gt;Delete tickers</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>This function allows you to delete tickers from the list. Just select the 
      items you want to delete from the list view (multiple selection possible 
      by holding SHIFT or CTRL key while clicking on items), and choose this function.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Edit-&gt;Mark all, Edit-&gt;Unmark all, Edit-&gt;Toggle, Edit-&gt;Mark 
    selection, Edit-&gt;Unmark selection</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>These functions allow you to mark the tickers for download. Please note 
      that AmiQuote puts a checkmark before ticker name in the list view. ONLY 
      MARKED items will be downloaded. This allows you to perform selective downloads/updates.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>View-&gt;Refresh</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Basically AmiQuote handles refreshes by itself when needed. For example 
      if you changed the date range, the list will be refreshed before starting 
      download. But there are some cases when you may want to refresh the list 
      by yourself. For example if you downloaded and imported quotes once and 
      want to do this again you would need to choose this function. The Refresh 
      function simply applies all date and type settings to the URLs listed, and 
      MARKS all tickers for a new download.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Tools-&gt;Import into AmiBroker</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>This function is useful if you want to import just downloaded quotes into 
      AmiBroker but you have <b>Automatic import</b> checkbox cleared.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Tools-&gt;Get tickers from AmiBroker</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>This function retrieves all stocks from currently loaded AmiBroker database 
      and fills the AmiQuote ticker list with them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Tools-&gt;Get last update date</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>This function retrieves the date of the most recent quotation of the first 
      stock present in currently loaded AmiBroker database and sets the <b>From</b> 
      date to this date.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Tools-&gt;Settings</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Displays the settings window where you can define the destination directory 
      where all downloads are stored. Note that blank destination directory means 
      that downloads will be stored in the current working directory (in most 
      cases this is the folder from where current .TLS file was loaded).</p>
    <p>In this window you can also change the mode of writing the files. By default 
      historical files are overwritten while daily files get appended. This is 
      recommended setup. Appending daily files simply allows you to create intra-day 
      historical files when you do the updates daily. You may change this behaviour 
      for your particular purpose.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>LIMITATIONS</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Intraday interval bar data (1-min, 5-min, 15-min, 60-min and 120-min) are 
    available for US securities only.<br>
    Historical data for international exchanges are usually much shorter than 
    for US markets.</p>
  <p>Because intraday bar data are downloaded from Quote.com servers the ticker 
    symbols for indices are different than those used by Yahoo. For complete reference 
    please check <a href="http://finance.lycos.com/home/misc/symbol_search.asp?options=i">http://finance.lycos.com/home/misc/symbol_search.asp?options=i</a></p>
  <p>Intraday bar data are limited to 500 bars regardless of bar interval. In 
    other words you always get 500 bars data, whenever these are 1-min, 5-min, 
    15-min, 60-min or 120-min data - so by choosing bigger interval you get data 
    from more days. This is the limitation imposed by free delayed Quote.com server.</p>

<p>Note: AmiQuote's OLE automation interface is available for REGISTERED AmiQuote
  users only and requires at least version 1.70 of AmiQuote. If you attempt to
  trigger download or import from OLE automation interface using unregistered
  version you will be presented with a message box telling you to register.</p>
<p>All AmiQuote automation is available via methods and properties of single
  object: <strong>AmiQuote.Document.</strong><br>
  After the initial installation, AmiQuote 1.70 must be run at least once in
  stand-alone mode in order to setup registry entries for AmiQuote.Document automation
  object
  properly. From then on you can use AmiQuote OLE automation.</p>
<p>To instantiate AmiQuote use standard CreateObject (VBScript and alike)
  or new ActiveXObject (JScript) statements:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>VBScript sample:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><code>Set AB = CreateObject(&quot;AmiQuote.Document&quot;)</code></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>JScript sample:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><code>AB = new ActiveXObject(&quot;AmiQuote.Document&quot;);</code></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Important: Note that AmiQuote.Document object is registered as multiple instance
  object so each call to CreateObject will launch a new instance of AmiQuote.

  <li><em align="left">integer</em> <strong>Interval<br>
    <br>
    </strong>allows to get/set the intraday bar interval for intraday sources
    (Livecharts/Integratir). The bar interval here is NOT expressed in minutes.
    There is a fixed number
    of intervals available (0..7) and they are encoded as follows:<br>
    <br>
  0
  - 1 minute bars<br>
  1 - 
  3 minute bars<br>
  2 - 
  5 minute bars<br>
  3 - 15 minute bars<br>
  4 - 30 minute bars<br>
  5 - 
  60 minute bars<br>
  6 - 120 minute bars<br>
  7 - daily bars

  <li><em align="left">integer</em> <strong>RunEvery<br>
    <br>
    </strong>allows to get/set the &quot;run every&quot; time (in minutes). &quot;Run every&quot;
    feature allows AmiQuote to repeat downloads automatically in fixed periods
    of time.
    If it
    is set
    to zero then no repeated downloads occur. If it is set to value higher then
    zero then AmiQuote will re-run the download after specified number of minutes.
    Please note that using this feature from automation has very little merrit
    because you have better control using Download() method and can trigger repeated
    downloads from your own code. Also be warned that RunEvery feature needs
    running AmiQuote instance while usually scripting engines shut down all automation
    objects when script is finished, therefore you would need to keep the script
    running all the time so AmiQuote object is not closed by the script.<strong><br>
    <br>
    </strong></li>
  <li><em align="left">integer</em> <strong>Source<br>
    <br>
    </strong>allows to get/set the data source. There is a fixed number of data sources
  available now and they are encoded as follows:<br>
  <br>
  0 - Yahoo Historical<br>
  1 - Yahoo Current<br>
  2 - 
  Lycos / Quote.com<br>
  3 - 
  MSN Historical<br>
  4 - 
  Forex<br>
  5 - Integratir<br>
  6 - Brite Futures<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><em align="left">date</em> <strong>To<br>
    <br>
    </strong>allows to get/set the end date for historical downloads. This property
    has OLE DATE type and when you are using JScript you have to use getVarDate()
    method of JScript Date object to convert from JScript type to OLE-compliant
    type. VB-like languages can get/set this property directly because VB internally
  uses the same date type as OLE.<strong> <br>

<p>Example 1: <br>
  Load ticker list from the file, download historical data since
  June 1st, 1995 using Yahoo, import to running instance of AmiBroker:<br>
</p>
<p><code>AQ = new ActiveXObject(&quot;AmiQuote.Document&quot;);<br>
  AQ.Open(&quot;C:\\mysymbols.tls&quot;);</code></p>
<p><code>FromDate = new Date(1995,5,1,0,0,0);<br>
</code><code>/* year, month-1, day, hour, min, sec
(required by JScript date constructor) */</code></p>
<p><code>  ToDate = new Date; // current time<br>
    <br>
    /* getVarDate is required to convert from JScript Date to OLE-automation
    date */<br>
  AQ.From = FromDate.getVarDate(); <br>
  AQ.To = ToDate.getVarDate(); <br>
  <br>
  AQ.AutoImport = true; // import automatically<br>
  AQ.Source = 0; // Yahoo Historical</code></p>
<p><code>AQ.Download(); // starts download</code></p>
<p><code>// wait until download and import is finished<br>
</code><code>while( AQ.DownloadInProgress || AQ.ImportInProgress )<br>
  {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WScript.sleep(5000); // wait 5 seconds before querying
  status again<br>
  }<br>
  <br>
WScript.echo(&quot;Download and import complete&quot;);</code></p>
<p><br>
  <br>
Example 2: <br>
Add symbols programmatically, download and import (from the code)</p>
<p><code><br>
  AQ = new ActiveXObject(&quot;AmiQuote.Document&quot;);<br>
AQ.AddSymbols(&quot;MSFT,NVDA,INTC,AAPL&quot;); // comma separated list of symbols </code></p>
<p><code>AQ.AutoImport = false; // no automatic import<br>
AQ.Source = 0; // Yahoo Historical</code></p>
<p><code>AQ.Download(); // starts download</code></p>
<p><code>while( AQ.DownloadInProgress || AQ.ImportInProgress )<br>
  {<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WScript.sleep(5000); // wait 5 seconds while AmiQuote is downloading <br>
  }</code></p>
<p><code>AQ.Import(); // starts download</code></p>
<p><code>while(  AQ.ImportInProgress )<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WScript.sleep(5000); // wait 5 seconds while AmiQuote is  importing<br>
}</code></p>
<p><code>WScript.echo(&quot;Download and import complete&quot;);</code></p>
